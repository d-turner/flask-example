~~~ Show installed modules
help("modules")

~~~ Create new virtual environment
 $ virtualenv <DIR>
 $ source <DIR>/bin/activate
 this will set the current shell to use the virtualenvironment
 use -p option to set the interpreter
   e.g. -p /usr/bin/python2.7

 to exit virtual environment
 $ deactivate

 Running virtualenv with the option --no-site-packages
 will not include the packages that are installed globally

 In order to keep your environment consistent,
 it's a good idea to 'freeze' the current state of the environment packages.
 $ pip freeze > requirements.txt
 Then you can reinstall the environment with
 $ pip install -r requirements.txt
