# create new virtual environment
# $ virtualenv <DIR>
# $ source <DIR>/bin/activate
# this will set the current shell to use the virtualenvironment
# use -p option to set the interpreter
#   e.g. -p /usr/bin/python2.7

# to exit virtual environment
# $ deactivate

# Running virtualenv with the option --no-site-packages
# will not include the packages that are installed globally

# In order to keep your environment consistent,
# it's a good idea to 'freeze' the current state of the environment packages.
# $ pip freeze > requirements.txt
# Then you can reinstall the environment with
# $ pip install -r requirements.txt
